# Time Off Management

## Project Description

We are tasked with creating a Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM Canvas application in which users inside of an organization would have the ability to request Time Off. The Time Off Application contains a list of supervisors to submit the request to as well as start and end dates for the leave request. The request would then automatically be sent to the supervisor for approval upon submission. Users can log in to a current account or register for an account. User then have a profile page they can access and change all aspect of their profile that includes a profile photo that can be taken from the user's webcam. The users' time off balances are calculated dynamically and updated in real-time through the application and stored onto the database on the back end through SharePoint.

## Technologies Used

* Microsoft Power Apps
* Microsoft SharePoint
* Microsoft PowerAutomate

## Features

* Secure Signin/Signout
* Secure Registration
* Dynamically Displayed and Updated Profile Page with Profile Photo
* Time Off Requests can be made by any non-admin user
* Supervisors receive an email upon request submission
* Supervisors can approve/reject requests via email
* Users' time off balances are deducted the appropriate time upon supervisor approval
* Supervisors can see all employees of the organization

* SharePoint dynamically stores users and requests in separate tables

## Potential Improvements
* Allow admin/supervisor to dynamically approval/reject requests on app
* User's individual time balances would accrue based on department and time worked with a hard cap for annual rollover
